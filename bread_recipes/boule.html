    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>An increadibly ease, crusty white bread recipe cooked inside a Dutch Oven, quite delectable</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 Â½ cups water</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Place bread flour into the bowl of an electric stand mixer and pour in water, followed by salt. </p>
    <p>Sprinkle yeast over the surface and allow to dissolve and turn creamy, about 5 minutes.</p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Mix on medium speed using the paddle attachment until dough comes together. Replace the paddle with the dough hook and continue mixing until dough is smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes.</p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow dough to rise until doubled in size, 30 to 45 minutes.</p>
    <p>Push a finger into dough; it should give some resistance, but not spring back. If it springs back, let it rise longer.</p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Turn dough out onto a floured surface and punch down to expel excess gas and redistribute yeast. Cover with a clean dish towel and let rest, 10 to 15 minutes.</p>

    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Shape dough into a boule by pushing it back and forth on the counter in a circular motion until you have a round, smooth ball.</p>
    <p>Cover dough with a clean dish towel and allow to rise, about 1 hour.</p>
    
    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Grease a Dutch oven with cooking spray.</p>

    <h4>Step 7</h4>
    <p>Slice a very shallow "X" into the top of dough with a sharp knife to help it expand while baking. Place loaf into the prepared Dutch oven and cover with the lid.</p>

    <h4>Step 8</h4>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Reduce temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) and continue to bake, covered, for 20 minutes.</p>
    <p>Remove the lid and continue baking until loaf is deep golden, 25 to 30 minutes.</p>
