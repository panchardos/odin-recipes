    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons bread machine yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Place flour, 1 cup water, sugar, yeast, and salt into a bread machine pan in the order recommended by manufacturer. Select Dough cycle; press Start.</p>
    <p>While the cycle is running, grease a bowl and cookie sheet with cooking spray; set them aside.</p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>When the cycle is complete, place dough in the greased bowl, turning to coat all sides.</p>
    <p>Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 30 minutes. Dough is ready if indentation remains when touched.</p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Punch down dough and transfer to a lightly floured surface. Roll into a 16-x12-inch rectangle. Cut dough in half, creating two 8-x12-inch rectangles. Roll up each half of dough tightly, beginning at a long side, pounding out any air bubbles as you go. Roll gently back and forth to taper ends.</p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Place 3 inches apart on the greased cookie sheet. Make deep diagonal slashes across loaves every 2 inches or one lengthwise slash on each loaf. Cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, 30 to 40 minutes.</p>

    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
    <p>Mix egg yolk with 1 tablespoon water in a small bowl; brush over tops of loaves.</p>

    <h4>Step 6</h4>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes</p>
