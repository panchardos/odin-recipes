    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Two ingredient dough recipe, topped with a garlic-Parmesan butter, hot out of the oven. Really good when you have no time</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h3>Two Ingredient Dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups self-rising flour, plus more for kneading</li>
        <li>1 cup whole-milk plain Greek yogurt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Topping</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt with parsley, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
     
    <h3>Directions</h3>
     
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</p>
     
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Mix flour and yogurt together in a medium bowl until it forms a ball. Transfer to a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth, adding more flour as necessary to keep dough from sticking, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>
     
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Divide dough into 8 equal portions. Roll into breadsticks approximately 6 inches long and place on the prepared baking sheet, slightly flattening them down. Brush with 1 tablespoon of the melted butter.</p>
     
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Combine remaining melted butter with Parmesan cheese and garlic salt. Keep warm and set aside.</p>
     
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Bake breadsticks in the preheated oven until lightly browned, 18 to 20 minutes. Immediately upon removing from oven, brush with garlic-Parmesan mixture and serve.</p>
