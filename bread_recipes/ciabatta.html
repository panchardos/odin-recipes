    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>3 ¼ cups bread flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons bread machine yeast</li>
    </ul>
     
    <h3>Directions</h3>
     
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Place water, olive oil, bread flour, salt, sugar, and yeast into a bread machine in the order listed, or follow the order recommended by the manufacturer if different. Run the Dough cycle, about 90 minutes.</p>
     
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Remove dough from the machine after the cycle is done. It will be quite sticky and wet; resist the temptation to add more flour. Place dough onto a generously floured board, cover with a large bowl or greased plastic wrap, and let rest for 15 minutes.</p>
     
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Lightly flour two baking sheets or line them with parchment paper. Cut dough with a serrated knife into two equal pieces; form each into piece into a 3x14-inch oval. Tranfer loaves to the prepared baking sheets and dust lightly with flour. Cover and let rise in a draft-free place for approximately 45 minutes.</p>
     
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</p>
     
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Spritz loaves with water, then place onto the middle rack of the preheated oven. Bake until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.</p>
